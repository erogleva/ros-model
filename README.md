This repository holds a family of metamodels defined as ecore models that together with its java and Xtext and Xtend grammar implementations facilitates the use of a set of tools and graphical plugins to create models from ROS code, compose and validate the composition of models, autogenerate deployment artifacts and check the use of standard specifications.

For further information about the metamodels, please check the [IRC19 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8675668)
